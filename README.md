## What is StockSavvy?

StockSavvy is a platform which helps increase the financial literacy of highschoolers. We offer a forum feature for the community to answer any questions, and a question bank feature for users to review and test their knowledge!

## Contributions?

Contributions are allowed! We ask that you follow certain rules whilst making contributions. All work that you do will be **voluntary** and not privy to payment. However, you can use **your** contributions as work experience for any future work you might apply for. This can only be done if you follow our rules as listed below...

#### The rules:

First, create a development branch for your work. **DO NOT COMMIT ON MAIN** 
The branch should have the following naming structure: `YOUR NAME/GITHUB USER/1-2 WORDS ON THE CONTRIBUTION MADE` Examples of such naming structure include `hemit99123/about-page`

Now create a PR (pull request) to merge that development branch to the main branch. The naming of the PR should start off with:

- feat: (for a new feature)
- fix: (for a fix to a bug/feature not working)
- chore: (for any other task that does not fit the other 2 categories)
  
**Comments documenting your progress should be added into the PR's discussion.**
